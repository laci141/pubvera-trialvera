# Stage 1 builds the web server for linux/amd64 from ./main.go. The runtime stage
# copies a PRE-BUILT linux/amd64 CLI binary (bin/clinical-trials-pp-cli-linux),
# produced by vendor-cli.sh — a Windows .exe cannot run in a Linux container.

# forward_auth — see the pubvera-infra repo. The comment here used to say Render
# sets $PORT; that was true before the move and is not now, and render.yaml,
# deleted alongside this edit, claimed the same thing.
